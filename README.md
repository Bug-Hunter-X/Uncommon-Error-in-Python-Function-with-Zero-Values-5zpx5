This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function that handles zero values in its arguments in an inconsistent manner. The function seems to work correctly in some cases, but unexpectedly raises a ZeroDivisionError in others, depending on which parameter is zero. This inconsistency is a hidden bug that can be hard to detect, particularly in larger codebases.  The bug and its solution are provided in separate Python files (bug.py and bugSolution.py).
